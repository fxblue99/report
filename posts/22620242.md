Week with three holidays, not much to do in terms of trading, and personally, I've got other priorities.

Now I can say I'm more comfortable with my trading routine.

I should trade when I can and feel comfortable since I don't live off of it.

But if I want the numbers to work for me, I need to take it seriously.

So, after taking it seriously, I took action by designing a plan, not just for trading, but for my responsibilities and how I handle everything in my life.

This led to deleting my Instagram account, documenting the whole process of creating my website on YouTube, and once it's done, moving all my content to my blog. This will allow me to focus more on what really matters to me right now...

My health, my trading, and my work.

So, from now on, I won't be too hard on myself about trading days but will take the necessary steps to gradually make room to trade the way I want to.

I'm going to make it happen, I'm going to put in the work to live off trading.
